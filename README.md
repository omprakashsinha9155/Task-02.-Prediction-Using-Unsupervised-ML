# Task-02.-Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
In prediction using unsupervised machine learning with the Iris dataset, the goal is to identify patterns and groupings within the data without using labeled output.  we use unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict the optimal number of clusters in the Iris dataset and represent these clusters visually, gaining insights from present data
